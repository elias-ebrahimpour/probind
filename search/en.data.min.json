It works with default settings.\n cp .env.example .env   Start all containers with Docker Compose\n NOTE: You must export the DOCKER_PROBIND_UID variable if your user ID is different from 1000. This will allow the docker to get permissions over your files.\n export DOCKER_PROBIND_UID=\u0026#34;$(id -u)\u0026#34; docker-compose build docker-compose up -d   Install dependencies with:\ndocker-compose exec app composer install   Seed database in order to play with some data\n NOTE: Remove --seed if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to seed sample data.\n docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed   Go to http://localhost/install and finish ProBIND installation.
